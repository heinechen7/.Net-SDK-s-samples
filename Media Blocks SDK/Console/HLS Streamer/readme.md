# Media Blocks SDK .Net - HLS Streaming Demo

The HLS Streamer app, built using VisioForge's Media Blocks SDK, showcases a straightforward way to stream video and audio content via the HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) protocol. It uses H264 and AAC encoders for video and audio compression to create a virtual streaming pipeline that outputs the media to an HLS sink. The application serves the streamed content on a local HTTP server accessible through http://localhost:8088/, demonstrating the integration of video and audio sources, encoders, and streaming output within a .NET environment. This example is ideal for developers looking to implement HLS streaming in their applications, providing a template for source-to-sink media processing and streaming.
