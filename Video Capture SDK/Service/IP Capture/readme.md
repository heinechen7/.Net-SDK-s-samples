# Video Capture SDK .Net - IP capture service Demo

This SDK sample for VisioForge's video capture service demonstrates how to create a Windows service for capturing video from IP cameras. The `Service1` class initializes the video capture process. It uses the `VideoCaptureCore` class to set the capture mode, source, and output format, specifically targeting MP4 output.

Additionally, it includes methods for starting and stopping the capture process, along with error handling that logs messages to Windows Events. This sample provides a practical example of integrating VisioForge's video capture capabilities into a service-based application.
